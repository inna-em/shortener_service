# shortener_service

This is my service for short links generation.
You need to clone it, install requirements by pip and make migrations.
*** 

It works on ```localhost:8000```. If you send ***POST***-request on ```localhost:8000```, which contents field **original_url** in the ***BODY*** you will get short link. This link will be redirected to your original url
